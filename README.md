### Pandas test.
<!--All data used are fictitious-->
My first study project using the Pandas library for data processing in conjunction with the Plotly Express library to create a chart containing the list of stores with their due billing.

Using Python in Jupyter, I elaborated a small code through the Pandas library that reads the data stored in ".csv" files, separates them into tables with the most important information and in the end, using Plotly Express, I made a simple graph that shows the revenue of each store from least to greatest.
